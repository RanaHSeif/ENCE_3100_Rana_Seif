# Lab 7 Report (UART Word Detector)

## Introduction
In this lab, we are creating a word detector that uses UART protocol to input any letter or number in ascii and if the word "hello" is detected, the full word along with rotating lights flash for 3 seconds. during the undetected states, the system should display the letters and numbers that the user inputs.

## State Machine
Below, image 1 shows the state diagram of the finite state machine.

## Main and other submodules
In order yo achieve ghat, we have 2 newly created submodules (the FSM and the 3 second counter).

## Final Results
The final results can be seen below in Video 1.
